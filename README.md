# Relation Schema Induction

Given a set of documents from a specific domain (e.g., medical research journals), how do we automatically build a Knowledge Graph (KG) for that domain? Automatic identification of relations and their schemas, i.e., type signature of arguments of relations (e.g., undergo(Patient, Surgery)), is an important first step towards this goal. We refer to this problem as Relation Schema Induction (RSI).

## SICTF

SICTF solves the problem of Relation Schema Induction, defined below. Given the surface triples as a Tensor, Noun Phrase Side Information as a Matrix and Relation similarity as a Matrix, SICTF performs a joint factorization. 


## Setup:

To get the project's source code, clone the github repository:

    $ git clone https://github.com/malllabiisc/sictf.git

Install VirtualEnv in python3 using the following (optional):

    $ [sudo] apt-get install python3-pip
    $ [sudo] pip3 install virtualenv 

Create and activate your virtual environment (optional):

    $ virtualenv venv
    $ source venv/bin/activate

Install all the required packages (dependencies):

    $ pip3 install -r requirements.txt


### Dependencies:

Please install the following dependencies for SCITF to run:
numpy, scipy, scikit-learn, joblib, python3.3 or above.



## Usage:

To use sictf, you can start with these following samples commands:

    $ python3 tensorCreatorForCNNRescalWithScores.py ../Data/Medline/ Triples.txt NpSideInfo.txt RelSim.txt
    $ python3 runCRescal.py outfolder 10 10 1 3 3 20 False 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1




## Help
Help for running the setup.

Place the triples and side information in a folder at the same level as *.py scripts

Run the Following commands sequentially afterwards ( with -h flag for help)

    python3 tensorCreatorForCNNRescalWithScores.py

usage: tensorCreatorForCNNRescalWithScores.py [-h]
                                              inputFolder fname sideInfoMatrix
                                              relSim

### positional arguments:
  * inputFolder   --  Enter the name of folder which containts the data file
  * fname         --  Enter name of the file that is the source of triplets
  * sideInfoMatrix -- Enter the name the file that contains side information
  * relSim         -- Enter the name of the file that contains Verb phrase Similarity information

### optional arguments:
  -h, --help      show this help message and exit
